# Software Architecture Document (SAD)
  

## Publish and subscribe style 

**Why we implemented it**
Given the size of messages, the system implements a publish and subscribe architecture as a means of communication between components.  

**How we implemented it**
In order to achieve this, our team made use of the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport, also known as "MQTT". To ensure the arrival of the messages the whole system is set up with QOS 2, meaning the clients and servers will ensure the message has been received. All component communication is made through MQTT, and components dynamically subscribe and write to components depending on user interactions to efficiently process and respond to messages. For example, when a user selects a time and day to search for an appointment, the user client sends a message and temporarily subscribes to the response topic until an answer has arrived.

**Where we implemented it**
  

![publish subscribe diagram](./img/PubSubDiagram.png " publish subscribe diagram")

  

## Pipeline style

**Why we implemented it**
In order to safeguard the application from users accidentally/purposely making identical booking requests, the system will implement the pipeline style between the User Client component and the Booking component. Since we have many components interacting with each other we determined that a pipeline architecture style would be appropriate, as it makes for a very modular design.

**How we implemented it**
When any message is received in the time booking management component on a defined topic that it is subscribed to, the message will be handled according to what information it contains using functions that are defined as filters. The filter does various tasks when it receives a message. It can change a parameter of a message, compare a parameter of the message to what is in the database and so on. The message then enters its final filter, which becomes the data destination. This is often a publish function that sends back the data to the frontend.
  
**Where we implemented it**
![pipeline diagram](./img/pipeline.png "pipeline diagram")

  

  

## Layered style

  

### The layered style has been implemented in the system to perform a separation of concerns:

  

**Why we implemented it**

We implemented layered architecture in order to efficiently divide the work into a simple and clear separation of concerts. A contributing factor to our decision was the reduced dependency because the function of each layer is separate from the other layers. This separation of concerns also made our testing efforts easier to implement in our continuous development cycle.

**Where we implemented it**

To create a layered architecture, we categorized our components in the following layers:

-   Frontend: User / Dentist Clients
    
-   Backend: User authentication / Booking management
    
-   Database: MongoDB
    

**How we implemented it**

The components execute a clear separation of concerns, depicted in the following functional decomposition diagram:
  


  

  

### In order to implement the aforementioned functionalities, we will make use of the following frameworks and resources:

  

● UI User client: Vue.js 2, Vue-Mqtt

  

● UI Dentist client: Vue.js 2, Vue-Mqtt

  

● User authentication management: Auth0 / Firebase, Express, Node.js, Mqtt

  

● Time booking management: Express, Node.js, Mqtt

  

● Dentists office location map: Express, Node.js, Mqtt, Leaflet.js / Google maps API / openlayers

  

### Example use Case:

  

![Sequence diagram](./img/SeqDiagram.png "Sequence diagram")

  
## Traceability
The project is made up of 5 repositories within the gitlab group [“T-6”](https://git.chalmers.se/courses/dit355/dit356-2022/t-6). All information regarding the management of the project and the architecture has been collected in the [T6 Project repository](https://git.chalmers.se/courses/dit355/dit356-2022/t-6/t6-project). Aside from the main repository, there is one repository per component, each containing the code product, the relevant issues that make up the product, as well as a readme file detailing the use of the component, the architecture, the authors and other relevant information. In order to add traceability our team created an issue for every user story, these can be found on trello and gitlab. Linked to every user story, we created a branch to implement the code for the component, changes to documentation, the CI and the initial template were directly pushed to main.

  

This is an example of how traceability was added, which allows anyone to see where code for a certain functionality was implemented:

1.  To see the status of a task we can click on the [trello card](https://trello.com/c/zUcDY2HY/76-search-appointment-page) linked to it. In the description we find the following information: the member assigned to the task, in this case Juan, the milestone this task belongs to, in this case milestone 3 and lastly, a [link](https://git.chalmers.se/courses/dit355/dit356-2022/t-6/user-client/-/issues/3) to the relevant issue.  

2.  By clicking the [link](https://git.chalmers.se/courses/dit355/dit356-2022/t-6/user-client/-/issues/3) we can access the gitlab issue detailing what was implemented in this task. In this case we can see the following information. This user page included two user stories and 4 different acceptance criteria, in order to see how this was implemented, you can scroll down and see the connected [merge request](https://git.chalmers.se/courses/dit355/dit356-2022/t-6/user-client/-/merge_requests/2).
    

3. By clicking on the [merge request](https://git.chalmers.se/courses/dit355/dit356-2022/t-6/user-client/-/merge_requests/2). You are taken to a page where you can see relevant information, including a log of all commits, who approved and reviewed the merge request, in this case Carlotta and lastly the state of the CI pipeline, which in this page can be seen as a green tick, indicating its success.
## Architecture decisions and tactics

  

### ASRs:

-   **Availability:** Given the fact that the system shall provide dentist appointment bookings for all citizens of Gothenburg.

-  **Simplicity:** Given the fact that the system will serve a single purpose, simplicity becomes important. This is also reflected in the architectural styles that have been chosen.
    
-  **Performance:** Given that this system will be used yearly by more than half a million users, it shall be able to handle thousands of concurrent users. This can be achieved using a "publish and subscribe" architecture as it provides light-weight messaging.
  
-   **Usability:** Given that the end goal is the release of a product for a large number of users with vastly different levels of technological literacy.
 
- **Reliability:** Given that the system will be under constant stress of large numbers of concurrent users, system is expected to work despite the possibility of individual components not working

  

### Design decisions regarding components:

We have chosen to implement four different components to create a modular and well structured system:

● UI User client

● UI Dentist client

● User authentication management

● Time booking managemen  
  

### Design decisions regarding technologies:

  

**Vue** was chosen for various reasons: Vue can help create **code bases that are maintainable and testable**; Vue allows splitting a web page into reusable components and promotes separation of concern. Using Vue's command line tools makes it very easy to quickly initialize a project.

> The team has decided to use Vue 2 instead of Vue 3 because of unclear MQTT compatibility with Vue 3.

**Nodejs** was chosen due to the fact that the developer team has experience with it. Choosing familiar technology has the benefit of allowing reallocation of resources that would otherwise have been used for learning.

  

# Program Management Report (PMR):

  

## Project management methodology

  

Considering the valuable work we are conducting in the parallel course: DIT348 Software Development Methodologies, We have decided to make use of Scrum, with applied user story practice and incremental delivery. As defined by the following SPEM diagram:

  

![SPEM diagram](./img/SPEM2.png "SPEM diagram")

  

  

The process works in the following manner: the team will commence with the product backlog(The Project assignment brief) given to us by the product owner(Examiner + TA), from the backlog the team will create user stories with acceptance criteria, which will become the user story backlog. With the user story backlog, our team will plan increments, in which the user stories will be implemented, after every increment, the team will conduct a review and retrospective, as well as deploying any accepted changes.

  

  

## Management decisions and Products of the first milestone

  

- Juan was elected scrum master

- Contract was drafted

- Team members created the SRS document.

- Team members created Diagrams to depict our design for the product based on the specifications

  

## Management decisions and Products of the second milestone
